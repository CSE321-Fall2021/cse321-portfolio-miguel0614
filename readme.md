This repository serves as a portfolio of the work done in CSE321. This will contain work from:
* Project 1

Introductory project that establishes good coding practices and documentation standards
* Project 2: Timer System

The system being constructed serves as a count-up or count-down timer. This system will take input from a 4x4 matrix keypad and output to a 1602 LCD to display the user interface and LEDs to indicate when a valid button is pressed or if the alarm is finished.

The Nucleo-L4R5ZI will be the microcontroller used to control this system. It will be used to control the interrupts from the matrix keypad and the GPIO digital input/output. 

* Project 3

and all other associated files.
