This repository serves as a portfolio of the work done in CSE321. This will contain work from:
* Project 1

Introductory project that establishes good coding practices and documentation standards
* Project 2: Timer System

The system being constructed serves as a count-up or count-down timer. This system will take input from a 4x4 matrix keypad and output to a 1602 LCD to display the user interface and LEDs to indicate when a valid button is pressed or if the alarm is finished.

The Nucleo-L4R5ZI will be the microcontroller used to control this system. It will be used to control the interrupts from the matrix keypad and the GPIO digital input/output. 

* Project 3: Security Alarm System

This system is a traditional securtity alarm system which will be used to contribute in the public interest of safety by providing consumers with the peace of mind of a safer area. This is acheived by using an ultrasonic sensor to keep track of nearby objects and a microphone to detect loud noises. If these are detected, the system will activate and notify the user that something has been detected. The user can interact with the system by using a keypad to arm/disarm the system through the LCD interface.
